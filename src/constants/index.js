      'This project is about a responsive food delivery web app that allows users to browse, select, and order food seamlessly. The user-friendly UI, built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensures a modern and smooth experience. Dynamic product pages enable users to explore food items before adding them to the cart, while an intuitive cart system allows them to review and modify selections before checkout. I designed a payment flow UI for entering order details and completing transactions and integrated React Router for seamless navigation between home, product, cart, and login pages. Additionally, I developed a login page UI, laying the foundation for authentication (backend integration pending), and optimized the app for mobile responsiveness and performance to enhance the user experience.',
